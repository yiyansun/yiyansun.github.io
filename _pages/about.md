My name is Yiyan Sun. I am doing my master degree in Urban Spatial Science at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis ([CASA] (https://casa.ucl.ac.uk/)) at University College London (UCL).

My main research interests are in ecosystem services, especially in ecological and spatial planning of protected areas based on ecosystem services and carbon neutrality. Focus on analyzing the changes in social-ecological system status in human-land coupling areas, I explore sustainable ecological management options and spatial optimization of nature reserves based on the supply-demand and trade-off methods of ecosystem services, such as identifying key conservation areas and constructing conservation area networks under different scenarios.
